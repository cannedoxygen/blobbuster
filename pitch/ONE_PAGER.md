# BLOCKBUSTER ONE-PAGER
## The Streaming Platform They Can't Kill

---

## 🎯 THE PITCH IN 60 SECONDS

**Blockbuster** is a decentralized Netflix built on Sui blockchain where creators earn 70% of revenue (vs. <10% on traditional platforms). Members pay $5/month for unlimited streaming and receive a personalized NFT membership card. Content is stored permanently on Walrus Protocol and can never be censored.

**We're live on mainnet. Deployed. Working. Ready to scale.**

---

## 💔 THE PROBLEM

**Creators:** Netflix/YouTube take 90%+ of revenue, remove content arbitrarily, zero transparency

**Viewers:** Rising costs ($15-20/month), centralized control, privacy concerns

**Web3 solutions:** Too complicated, slow, speculation-focused

---

## ✨ THE SOLUTION

**Simple UX**: $5/month → Unlimited HD streaming → Personalized NFT card

**Fair Economics**: 70% to creators (weighted by watch completion) + 30% to platform

**Unstoppable Tech**: Sui blockchain (2-3s finality) + Walrus storage (decentralized, permanent)

---
