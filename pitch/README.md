Subject: [Warm intro] Blockbuster on Sui - Decentralized Netflix

Hi [Name],

Remember Blockbuster Video? We're bringing it back — decentralized, unstoppable, and creator-first.

Blockbuster is a streaming platform on Sui blockchain where creators earn 70% of revenue (vs. <10% on Netflix). We're live on mainnet with deployed contracts and working code.

Key stats:
• $70B streaming market
• 70/30 revenue split (sustainable economics)
• $5/month simple membership
• 2-3 second transaction finality on Sui

We're raising $50k bootstrap funding for a 90-day beta launch. Would love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 🎤 PRESENTATION TIPS

### Before the Meeting

- **Research the investor**: Know their portfolio, thesis, recent tweets
- **Practice timing**: 12-15 minutes leaves 5 min for Q&A
- **Prepare demo**: Have the app open, ready to show streaming
- **Print one-pagers**: Bring physical copies as leave-behinds

### During the Presentation

- **Start with a hook**: "Remember when Netflix killed Blockbuster? We're bringing it back on blockchain."
- **Speak with energy**: This is a fun, nostalgic brand!
- **Pause for impact**: After key stats (70%, $5/month, 2-3s)
- **Make eye contact**: Don't read slides
- **Show the product**: Demo beats slides every time

### Handling Questions

**Q: "Is this legal? What about piracy?"**
- A: "Yes, we moderate like YouTube. Admin approval workflow, DMCA compliance, user liability agreements."

**Q: "Why Sui over Ethereum or Solana?"**
- A: "100x faster (2-3s vs 20-30s), 1000x cheaper ($0.01 vs $2-50 gas), built by same team as Walrus for tight integration."

**Q: "What if creators don't upload content?"**
- A: "$500 upload bounties to seed library, film school partnerships, 80% revenue share promotion for first month."

**Q: "How do you compete with Netflix's content library?"**
- A: "We don't. We're targeting independent filmmakers, film students, and niche audiences tired of centralized platforms. Quality over quantity."

**Q: "What's your defensibility / moat?"**
- A: "First mover on Sui, network effects (more creators → more viewers → more creators), smart contract IP, and the Blockbuster brand nostalgia."
