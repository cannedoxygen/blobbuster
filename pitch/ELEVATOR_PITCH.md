## 🚀 THE 10-SECOND PITCH (Networking Events)

**"Blockbuster is back — as a decentralized Netflix on Sui blockchain where creators earn 70% of revenue instead of 10%."**

*Follow-up if interested:* "We're live on mainnet, deployed smart contracts, raising $50k to launch."

## ⏱️ THE 30-SECOND PITCH (Investor Intro)

**"Remember Blockbuster Video? We're resurrecting it on blockchain.**

Blockbuster is a streaming platform built on Sui where independent filmmakers earn 70% of revenue — versus less than 10% on Netflix.

Members pay $5/month for unlimited streaming and get a personalized NFT membership card. All content is stored on Walrus Protocol, making it permanent and censorship-resistant.

We're deployed on mainnet with working code. Raising $50k bootstrap funding to launch our beta with 1,000 users in 90 days."

## 💼 THE 2-MINUTE PITCH (Investor Meeting Intro)

**"Streaming is broken for everyone.**

Creators get screwed: Netflix takes 90% of revenue, YouTube pays pennies, and platforms remove content arbitrarily with zero transparency.

Viewers get screwed: Subscriptions are $15-20/month and rising, platforms cancel your favorite shows, and your data is the product.

Web3 tried to fix this but made it worse with complicated tokenomics and slow blockchains.

**We're Blockbuster — the streaming platform they can't kill.**

Simple as Netflix: $5/month, unlimited HD streaming, watch on any device.

Fair as Patreon: 70% of revenue goes to creators based on watch completion. If people finish your movie, you earn more. Quality over quantity.

Unstoppable as Bitcoin: Content is stored on Walrus Protocol — decentralized, permanent, censorship-resistant. Smart contracts on Sui execute in 2-3 seconds with gas fees under a penny.

**We're not vaporware. We're live.**

Smart contracts deployed on Sui mainnet. Backend API running with 8 production services. NFT card generation working. Video transcoding pipeline tested with multi-gigabyte files.

The market is huge: $70 billion global streaming, $104 billion creator economy. We're targeting 10,000 members in year one — that's $600k revenue.

Break-even is 350 members. Our unit economics work: $5 acquisition cost, $18 lifetime value, 3-month payback.

**We're raising $50,000 bootstrap funding for a 90-day beta launch.**

Month 1: Audit smart contracts, polish UI, launch with 100 beta users.
Month 2: Onboard 50 creators, build library to 500 movies.
Month 3: Hit 1,000 paid members, $5k monthly revenue.

This is your chance to be first into the Sui streaming ecosystem before anyone else realizes the opportunity.

**Want to see it live?**"

## 🎯 AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC PITCHES

### For Crypto Investors

**"Blockbuster is the first major streaming platform built on Sui blockchain.**

We're leveraging Walrus Protocol for decentralized storage — same team that built Sui, tight integration. Sui's parallel execution lets us distribute revenue to 500 creators in 3 seconds versus 25 minutes sequentially.

This is a real utility play, not speculation. $5/month membership, unlimited streaming, 70% revenue share to creators. Deployed on mainnet, working code.

$50k ask for 90-day beta. First mover advantage in a $70B market."

### For Film Industry / Creators

**"Tired of Netflix and YouTube taking 90% of your revenue?**

Blockbuster pays creators 70% — transparently, on-chain, every week. No black box algorithms. No arbitrary demonetization.

Upload your film, we transcode to 480p/720p/1080p/4K, store it permanently on decentralized infrastructure. When viewers watch, you earn based on completion rate. Better content = higher completion = more money.

We're raising $50k to launch with 50 indie filmmakers. Want to be one of them?"

### For Non-Crypto Investors

**"Blockbuster is bringing back the legendary brand — but decentralized and creator-first.**

Think of it as Patreon meets Netflix. Creators upload movies, members pay $5/month for unlimited streaming. The twist: 70% of revenue goes to creators instead of a giant corporation taking 90%.

We use blockchain for transparent payments and decentralized storage so no single company controls the content. But the user experience is as simple as Netflix — connect wallet, pay $5, watch movies.

Deployed, working, ready to scale. $50k ask for beta launch."

### For Sui Foundation / Ecosystem Partners

**"We're building the flagship streaming platform for the Sui ecosystem.**

This is the first major consumer application showcasing Walrus decentralized storage. We're driving wallet adoption (every member needs Sui Wallet), demonstrating Move smart contract capabilities (parallel revenue distribution), and attracting creators to the Sui ecosystem.

We've deployed on mainnet, integrated Walrus CLI for large file uploads, and built dynamic NFT membership cards.

Asking for $50k grant to launch beta, create technical case study, and co-market with Mysten Labs. This will put Sui on the map for content creators worldwide."

## 🎤 SOUNDBITES (Quotable Lines)

Use these memorable phrases in any pitch:

1. **"The Blockbuster they tried to kill is back — decentralized, unstoppable, and creator-first."**

2. **"70% to creators, 30% to platform. Sustainable economics, not Silicon Valley fairy dust."**

3. **"Your membership isn't just a subscription — it's a personalized NFT card. Member #000042. Own your Netflix."**

4. **"Netflix takes 90%, we take 30%. The math is simple. The impact is massive."**

5. **"Built on Sui, stored on Walrus. 2-3 second finality, $0.01 gas fees. This is Web3 done right."**

6. **"First mover on Sui streaming. $70 billion market. No direct competition."**

7. **"We're not raising to build. We're raising to scale what already works."**

8. **"Break-even at 350 members. We'll hit that in month one."**

9. **"Remember Blockbuster Video? That nostalgia is our marketing budget."**

## 💬 RESPONDING TO SKEPTICISM

### "But blockchain is slow and expensive!"

**"Not Sui. 2-3 second finality, gas fees under a penny. We're not using Ethereum. This is next-gen blockchain."**

### "Creators won't understand crypto!"

**"They don't need to. Connect wallet, upload video, get paid in SUI. We convert to USD if they want. Simple as Patreon."**

### "What about piracy?"

**"Same playbook as YouTube: Admin approval before content goes live, DMCA takedown procedures, user liability agreements. Moderation is part of the business."**

### "Netflix will crush you!"

**"Netflix can't offer 70% revenue share. Their entire business model is taking 90%. We're not competing for Marvel movies. We're for indie creators tired of getting screwed."**

### "Why not just use YouTube?"

**"YouTube pays 55/45 split but demonetizes creators arbitrarily. No transparency. No control. We're fully decentralized — your content can never be removed without consensus."**

### "The market is too small!"

**"Creator economy is $104 billion. Streaming is $70 billion. Web3 video is $2 billion and growing. We need 0.01% market share to hit $6M revenue."**

### "What's your moat?"

**"First mover on Sui, network effects (more creators → more viewers), smart contract IP, and the Blockbuster brand nostalgia. Plus 6-month head start before competitors figure out Walrus + Sui."**
